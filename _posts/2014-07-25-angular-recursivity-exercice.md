I did this experiment few months ago to prepare me to the next feature I was going to implement at job.

This is a recursive table, a main group can contain criterions, segments and others groups and the same for all others groups inside.


## Demo:

<iframe style="border: 1px solid #bbb;width: 100%; height: 700px" src="http://embed.plnkr.co/M41k49/?t=run" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen">Loading plunk...</iframe>

Or you can clone this repository: [https://github.com/bertrandg/recursive-directive](https://github.com/bertrandg/recursive-directive)

## Production version:

You can test the production version here: [this-is-big.com](http://www.this-is-big.com)

This version is more complexe because all changes are instantly saved and some others things..

## Next step:

Next, I'm gonna add the drag & drop feature between element inside a same groug and then accross level.
