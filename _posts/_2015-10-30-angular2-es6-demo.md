Start with yeoman and the only angular2 generator: https://github.com/swirlycheetah/generator-angular2
But not happy with it, Gulp task was always breaking i don't know why..

So I started with this repo: https://github.com/pkozlowski-opensource/ng2-play
Best starting place from what I tested and read.

Use of ES6 (with Traceur)

Use of new router

And to complete all these new things for me, I give a try at SublimeText and let my old heavy Eclipse.
