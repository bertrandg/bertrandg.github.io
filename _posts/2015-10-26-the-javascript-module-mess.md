Nowadays, more and more web developers use modules when coding javascript. It's a nice way to organise files and share your work with community.

But, for people who don't use it everyday, all terms and librairies can be confusing: 
<code>CommonJS</code>, <code>RequireJS</code>, <code>ES6 Module</code>, <code>AMD</code>, <code>Browserify</code>, <code>SystemJS</code>, <code>Webpack</code>,... WTF!

So, for me and for developers a bit lost about that, I did this diagram:

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/js_modules/js-modules.png">

<center>[Note that I didn't add link between <code>ES6 Module loader</code> and <code>SystemJS</code> who use it for a better visibility]</center>

Hope it can helps some of you and tell me if I've made mistakes.
